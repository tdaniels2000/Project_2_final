# Project_2_final

When writing programs, I focus on ensuring that they are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module to manage all interactions with the database. This modular approach separated concerns, allowing changes to the database logic without affecting the rest of the system, making the program more adaptable. Furthermore, I documented my code thoroughly and used descriptive function names, which ensured that anyone revisiting the code (including future me) would understand its purpose and functionality. This technique also aided readability.

Working with a modular CRUD Python module had several advantages when connecting the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. Since the module handled all database interactions, it was easy to link the front-end dashboard directly to it without modifying the underlying logic. This reusability not only saved time but also reduced the chances of introducing errors. In the future, this CRUD module could be applied to other projects that involve similar database operations, such as managing data for different applications, automating administrative tasks, or developing new features with minimal effort.

As a computer scientist, problem-solving starts with breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, when Grazioso Salvare requested specific dashboard and database functionalities, I approached the problem by first analyzing the requirements and then designing a system that fulfilled them using both the dashboard widgets and the CRUD module. This structured approach allowed me to meet client expectations effectively and efficiently.
