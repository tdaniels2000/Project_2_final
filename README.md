# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs, I focus on ensuring that they are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module to manage all interactions with the database. This modular approach separated concerns, allowing changes to the database logic without affecting the rest of the system, making the program more adaptable. Furthermore, I documented my code thoroughly and used descriptive function names, which ensured that anyone revisiting the code (including future me) would understand its purpose and functionality. This technique also aided readability.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, problem-solving starts with breaking down complex requirements into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, when Grazioso Salvare requested specific dashboard and database functionalities, I approached the problem by first analyzing the requirements and then designing a system that fulfilled them using both the dashboard widgets and the CRUD module. This structured approach allowed me to meet client expectations effectively and efficiently. This project differed from previous assignments because it required not only coding but also understanding how to integrate multiple components (e.g., front-end dashboard and back-end database). In future projects, I would continue applying modular design, ensuring that the database meets client needs while being flexible enough for future adjustments. Techniques like normalization and indexing will be essential for optimizing the databaseâ€™s performance.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by creating systems that manage and process data efficiently. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the work I completed allows them to handle their data more effectively, streamlining their decision-making process. My contributions to this project, especially the integration of the dashboard and database, help the company visualize and manipulate data seamlessly. By using the CRUD Python module and dashboard together, Grazioso Salvare can now handle their tasks in a user-friendly, efficient manner, improving their overall workflow.
